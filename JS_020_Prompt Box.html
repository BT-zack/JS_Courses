<!-- JavaScript prompt() dialog box
The prompt() method in JavaScript is used to display a prompt box that prompts the user for the input. It is generally used to take the input from the user before entering the page. It can be written without using the window prefix. When the prompt box pops up, we have to click "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed.

The box is displayed using the prompt() method, which takes two arguments: The first argument is the label which displays in the text box, and the second argument is the default string, which displays in the textbox. The prompt box consists of two buttons, OK and Cancel. It returns null or the string entered by the user. When the user clicks "OK," the box returns the input value. Otherwise, it returns null on clicking "Cancel".

The prompt box takes the focus and forces the user to read the specified message. So, it should avoid overusing this method because it stops the user from accessing the other parts of the webpage until the box is closed.
